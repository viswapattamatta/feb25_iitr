1. Write your own algorithm or strategy to find log10. You can use 10**x. 
2. Two lines x1 --> x2 and x3 --> x4, print True, if overlapping or touching otherwise print False
3. Write SQ method, Write you own code to do SQRT
4. First write you own method to cube and then do cube root
5. Tower of Hanoi
6. A rectangle is represented by two opposite corners. Each corner is represented a two number (x, y). Given two rectangles, return True if they are touching or overlapping otherwise return false.
7. pythagoras
8. Distance between 2 points using Pythogoras
9. 3D distance
10. Calculate N dimetional distance 
11. Designing thermometer : 
    # when current 1, the teperature was 30
    # when currrent 2, the temperature was 35
    # when current will be 3, what would be the temperature 40
    # current = 4, temp = 45
    # current 2.1, temp = 35.5
12. Rate of change of output wrt input : 
    # I want to measure the rate of change of output with respect to input.
    # Slight increase input and observe how much output changes
    # find out the ratio of change of output wrt input
13. Write code to swap two variables values.
14  Level Up: Do it without using third variable
15. shift the arr by k places to left circularly without using extra array but you can use extra variable
16. Given three lists of numbers, return the list of their XORs
    all three lists have same size
17. You have a list of numbers, you have to reverse it.
18  Level up : Without using extra arr or you can say do it in place.
19. Write a function to print all possible numbers of length n where each digit could go from 0 to m-1.
20. Print all possible permutations of your name. Same length.
21. We need to predict the load on our website in near realtime.
    t = 0, load = 10 t = 1, load = 15 t = 2, load = 30 t = 3, load = ? t = 4, load = ?
    First write a method called fit(data) that returns a model and then write a method called predict(model, time) that returns the load
    It is known the load on the website is a non-linear equations i.e. load = a * t^2 + b * t + c
    Start with pen and papers. Do it manually first and then come up with a stragetegy to do with code.
